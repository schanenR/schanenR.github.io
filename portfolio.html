            <p class="blog">
                My first interest in computing came from research in Philosophy of Technology and a dedicated studio
                practice. I was led onward while reading and observing Lynn Hershman Leeson, Donna Haraway, Gilbert
                Simondon, Nam June Paik and many others. I encountered the potential of technical learning from a
                curiosity found in studying art, institutional critique, media studies, my own scrolling and an
                an alienation from being naive to my own tools architecture. My CS studies began after many years
                working in print and in close working relationship with a machine, the printing press. Over time,
                the idea of deeply understanding the most powerful tools of regular use because of great importance.
                I started dabbling in courses on Lynda.com and quickly realized puzzling over programs suited me.
